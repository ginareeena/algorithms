//Write a function that takes a Binary Tree and returns a list
//of its branch sums ordered from leftmost branch sum to right most branch sum

//A branch sum is the sum of all values in a Binary Tree branch. A Binary Tree branch is a path of nodes in a tree that starts at the root node and ends at any leaf node.

//Each BinaryTree has an integer value, a left child node and a right cild node.
//Children nodes can be either BinaryTree nodes themselves or None / null

// This is the class of the input root.
// Do not edit it.
class BinaryTree {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.left = null;
    this.right = null;
  }
}

function branchSums(root) {
  // Write your code here.
}
